	<p>Restaurants across the nation are experiencing the challenge of labor shortage. They have reported a loss of workers in both the kitchen and the front of house since the COVID-19 pandemic. Many workers did not return to work, and have chosen to seek other paths. Thus, restaurants continue to struggle to find and keep employees. 
	</p>

				<p>Owners, workers, and customers are all experiencing the burden and consequences of the labor crisis. Lack of workers means longer waits for customers, extra work for the staff and owners and an inability to increase business revenue. Workers are leaving for more money, consistent schedules and professional development opportunities. Furthermore, childcare and mental health are cited as reasons for leaving the industry.

					<h3>Lack of Employment</h3>

					<figcaption class="graphic-text">Restaurants gained 1.3 million jobs during the first seven months of 2021, but that is still 1 million jobs less than the pre-pandemic levels of employment, based on findings by <a href="https://www.restaurantdive.com/news/why-arent-restaurant-workers-coming-back-heres-what-the-data-shows/606198/">National Restaurant Association</a>. Compared to 2019, restaurants have 6.2 fewer employees in the kitchen, and 2.8 fewer employees in the front of house, according to <a href="https://marketing.blackboxintelligence.com/hubfs/Snagajob-Black-Box-Restaurant-Industry-Update-2021.pdf?utm_medium=email&_hsmi=217322009&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--tJS1Q_GM09bSdFl3J9VCsL3KEilfi6WMuK1kAy_Nbryr-Vvu-1v3tPfqqaxj_4lhpanHiu0iWiUVplGdZDIMkLUJnzyMBIgwK7G4W_fiz-Suz4gE&utm_content=217322009&utm_source=hs_automation">BlackBox Intelligence and Snagajob</a>.

	<h3>Impact on Customers</h3>
					<img src="images/clock.png">
					<figcaption class="graphic-text">According to <a href="https://www.yelpeconomicaverage.com/june-economic-recovery-report.html">Yelp Economic Average data</a>, in Q1 of 2022, restaurant visitors faced and mentioned long waits (23%) and short-staffing (229%) more than in reviews in Q1 of 2021. The customers, as well as restaurant owners and teams, are experiencing the consequences of the labor crisis. Restaurants face longer waits for food because of lack of kitchen staff, and longer waits on tables because of lack of servers.

					<figcaption class="graphic-text">According to <a href="https://marketing.blackboxintelligence.com/hubfs/Snagajob-Black-Box-Restaurant-Industry-Update-2021.pdf?utm_medium=email&_hsmi=217322009&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--tJS1Q_GM09bSdFl3J9VCsL3KEilfi6WMuK1kAy_Nbryr-Vvu-1v3tPfqqaxj_4lhpanHiu0iWiUVplGdZDIMkLUJnzyMBIgwK7G4W_fiz-Suz4gE&utm_content=217322009&utm_source=hs_automation">BlackBox Intelligence and Snagajob</a>, out of the 4700 restaurant workers surveyed, 87% of them responded that they would rather “have a set livable wage than tips.” In a study of why workers left the industry, 51% of them left for reasons related to low and inconsistent income. Other reasons included having a more consistent schedule and wanting promotional opportunities.

					<p>In order to address the understaffing problem, restaurants are resorting to desperate measures. Leland Eating and Drinking House and Amorina Cucina Rustica in Brooklyn, for example, are physically removing tables, cutting down menu options, and adapting technological automation to require less hours of labor from staff.</p>

					<p>The issue shows no sign of slowing down. How and how much the restaurant experience will change due to this issue remain to be seen. </p>
